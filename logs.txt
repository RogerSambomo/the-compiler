Generated thoughts: ['Observation: The task requires creating an architectural technical analysis for a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Python.\n\nThoughts: Before starting the analysis, it is important to understand the requirements and limitations of the calculator. For example, what is the maximum number of digits the calculator should be able to handle? Should the calculator be able to handle negative numbers? It is also important to consider the user interface and how the user will interact with the calculator. Once these factors are taken into account, we can start breaking down the problem into smaller components such as the algorithms needed for each operation and the classes that will be used to organize the code. We should also consider how to handle errors and edge cases such as dividing by zero. Finally, we should test the calculator thoroughly to ensure it is functioning correctly.']
